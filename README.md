### big bang simulation

This is my big bang simultion. It represents the process of hydogen fusion, with the lightest elements right at the start of the big bang. 

There are five elements, 'agents'

hyrdrogen, Lithium, Beryllium, helium, and 'plasma'(nothing).

When the hydrogens bump together there is a process called fusion, where they fuse together to make a helium nucleus. Lithium and beryllium are trace elements, which is why they are smaller, and 90% of universe today is still constructed from hyrdrogen atoms.

there is also a feature when you can 'play god'. By using mouse over you can speed up the process of hydrogen fustion. 

There are two variables called 'destroy'and 'destroyer' which you can swap the agents out of, this way you can chose which element you want to change into something else, like if you want to slow the process of the big bang, fusion could be the destroy and hydrogen could be the desroyer.

 I also did this kind of thing with the fusion, you can change which elements collide and turn into another with the 'turnInto' variable. Another vairable is the radius, which roughly controls how fast the bang happens. If the radius is set to one, the big bang will happen instantly (more realistic). However if it is closer to 30, it will happen very slowly and gradually.

My Z_background is a representation of the sectors of elemetents in the shape of the sun. Helium is mostly int the centre because fusion occurs uner imense pressure, but there is also helium reactions around the outside, as it does not only happen in the center, but when hydrogens collide.

As a rule, they all start off moving in a random direction, none are stationary for the purpose that the big bang is never stationary.

all agents have the collision rule, they can tell which their neighbours are. Only when hydrogen collides together and when helium collides with hydrogen does a reaction occur.
